## palindrome

**Difficulty**: Basic 

## Prompt 

Write a function called `palindrome` that returns `true` if a string is a palindrome or `false` if its not. A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward. You should ignore case when considering whether or not a string is a palindrome. For example, 

* "racecar" is a palindome 
* "RACecar" is also a palindrome

## Examples

```js
palindrome("RaceCar"); //=> true
palindrome("abba"); //=> true
palindrome("ab ba"); //=> true  
palindrome("inini"); //=> true
palindrome("coconuts"); //=>false
```
