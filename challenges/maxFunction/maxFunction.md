This	function	takes	as	input	two	functions,	f	and	g.		The	output	should	be	a	new	function	h,	with	
the	property	that	for	any	input	x	the	output	h(x)	is	equal	to	the	maximum	of	f(x)	and	g(x).		Note	
that	this	function	is	very	different	from	the	function	in	exercise	1,	but	the	two	are	very	closely	
related.
