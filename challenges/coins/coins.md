## coins

**Difficulty**: Basic

## Prompt 

Write a function called `coins` that takes as input an amount of money, measured in (an integer 
number of) cents, and outputs the minimum number of coins necessary to have that value. 
Assume that the *only* coins available are quarters (25 cents), dimes (10 cents), nickels (5 cents) and pennies (1 cent).

## Examples 

```js
coins(3) //=> 3
coins(56) //=> 4
coins(25) //=> 1
coins(192) //=> 11
```
