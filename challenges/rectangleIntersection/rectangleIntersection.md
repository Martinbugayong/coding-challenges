## rectangleIntersection

**Difficulty**: Medium

## Prompt 

Write a function called `rectangleIntersection` that accepts two objects as input. Each object contains information about a rectangle. More specifically each object looks like the one below: 

```js
let rectangle = {

    // coordinates of bottom-left corner
    leftX: 1,
    bottomY: 1,

    // width and height
    width: 6,
    height: 3,

};
```

The values above can be thought of as points on a Cartesian coordinate plane. `rectangleIntersection` should return the area in which the two rectangles overlap.
