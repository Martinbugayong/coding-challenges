## evenFibonacci 

**Difficulty**: Basic

## Prompt 

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values **DO NOT** exceed four million, write a function called `evenFibonacci` that returns the sum of the even-valued terms.

**Note**: Your `evenFibonacci` function should take *NO* parameters.

## Examples 

```js
evenFibonacci() //=> ?
```
