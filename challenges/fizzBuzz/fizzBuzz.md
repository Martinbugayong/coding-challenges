## fizzBuzz

**Difficulty**: Basic

## Prompt 

Write a function called `fizzBuzz` that accepts a number - `n` - as an argument and returns an array. This array should have the numbers in the range of 1 to n. Numbers that are divisible by 3 should be replaced by `"Fizz"`, numbers that are divisible by 5 should be replaced by `"Buzz"` and numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 should be replaced by `"FizzBuzz"`. 

## Examples 

```js
fizzBuzz(15) //=> [1,2,"Fizz",4,"Buzz",6,7,8,"Fizz","Buzz",11,12,13,14,"FizzBuzz"]
fizzBuzz(5) //=> [1,2,"Fizz",4,"Buzz"]
```
